So, this is the place for fun. These are just simple
examples and proof of concepts made in Unity 3D. You
are mostly welcome to download and run. And remember
nothing serious, just for fun :)

Asteroids: This is a proof of concept of a 2D game
based on that old ATARI game to destroy asteroids
on the space.

Dumdois: Just a prototype of a FPS.

generic_mario: Just a prototype of a side-scrolling
2D platform based game.
